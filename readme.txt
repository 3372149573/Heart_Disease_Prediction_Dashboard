To run this project, make sure you have Python (3.10 or higher) and Node.js (18 or higher) installed on your computer. Start by setting up the backend. Open a terminal inside the backend folder and create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv. Then activate it with venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux. After that, install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the installation is complete, start the backend server with the command python app.py. The backend will run on http://localhost:5001
.

Next, open another terminal window, go to the frontend folder, and install all the dependencies by running npm install. When itâ€™s done, start the frontend with npm start. This will launch the React app on http://localhost:3000
. Make sure both the backend and frontend are running at the same time for everything to work properly.

If you encounter any errors, check that all dependencies are installed correctly and that the backend is running before opening the frontend. You can stop either process anytime by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
